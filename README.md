Here is MATLAB code I have developed for doing some of my administrative work. 
Probably kind of a waste of time, but the alternative is to click away in Excel

Items included here:
randgradstitle9.m -- simple read excel two columns with name and gender code, separate by gender and then randomly select 6 from each
